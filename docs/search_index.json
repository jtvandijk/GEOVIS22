In this session of the 2022 International Spring School on Visualisation we will be mapping surnames across Great Britain. The Lecture What’s in a name? Visualising surname geographies in a GIS environment should have given you a good introduction onto why we would want to do this, but in case you want some further details on previous work using surnames in an analytical context you may want to have a look at some of the papers in the background reading section listed below.

[Link] Session format This computer practical consists of four sections. Each section should take you around 20 minutes to complete, depending on your familiarity with GIS you may take longer or shorter. After each section you should pause, and we will jointly go through all the steps and instructions. This allows everyone without some GIS familiarity to catch-up, if necessary, and everyone with some GIS experience to play around with additional visualisation options and the opportunity to gain a more in-depth understanding of the processes and methods underlying these visualisations. Some general pointers: The instructions provided are based on QGIS 3.16 (long term release) for Windows. These instructions should be (almost) identical for most QGIS 3.x versions as well as for most operation systems (specifically macOS). That being said: there may be some small differences here and there in terms of how the actual windows and tabs may look like. Read the instructions carefully and use the animated GIFs to determine what is happening in each of the individual steps, especially if there are some small differences between your own installation of QGIS and the instructions provided. Use the Menu / Table of Contents / sidebar on the left-hand side of this page to navigate through the individual sections. Take your time. If you feel like you are falling behind, do not worry, try to get along as good as you can. This resource will remain available for the foreseeable future so you can always come back and try it again at your own pace. Note You can hide and show the sidebar (Table of Contents) with the Toggle Sidebar button in the menu bar at the top of the page.

If you have not already done so, you can download a copy of QGIS to your own computer through the QGIS webpage. Figure 1.1: Download page for QGIS. [Enlarge image] Note The instructions provided are based on QGIS 3.16 (long term release) for Windows. These instructions should be (almost) identical for most QGIS 3.x versions as well as for most operation systems (specifically macOS). That being said: there may be some small differences here and there in terms of how the actual windows and tabs may look like. 1.2 Data preparation We have prepared several data sets with the locations of the bearers of five different surnames (Longley, Van Dijk, Novak, Smith, and Rossall) that are present in Great Britain in 2016. In addition to the surname data, we also prepared a data set containing the simplified boundaries of Great Britain and a dataset containing the names of locations of several large cities. We will use these simplified boundaries and cities to contextualise our map. Note For privacy reasons the surname data you will be using are not actual data but are made to closely represent the actual data. Download both files to the Downloads folder on computer by following the links below. File download File Type Link XY locations for selected surnames zip csv Download XY locations of selected cities in Great Britain zip shp Download Simplified boundaries of Great Britain zip shp Download After downloading all three files, go to your Downloads folder and make you unzip both files: On Windows you can do this by right clicking on the surname_data.zip and gb_outline.zip folders and opting for Extract all. On macOS you can double click on the zipped folders to extract them. The data, which was stored in a compressed format (zip), should now be extracted and ready for use within QGIS. Your Downloads folder should look something like this: Figure 1.2: Your Download folder should now contain three unzipped folders containing our surname data and our reference data. [Enlarge image] The final step we need to take is to copy our downloaded data to a new folder. In your Documents folder on your computer, create a new folder GEOVIS22. We will use this folder as our working directory. Now move all folders containing the surname data, the Great Britain outline data and the citie data that you unzipped from your Downloads folder to this new GEOVIS22 folder. Your working directory should look like something like this: Figure 1.3: Your working directory is now all set up. [Enlarge image] Note The gb_outline and gb_cities files that we downloaded are something called a shapefile. A shapefile is a file that GIS software uses to store spatial data. In the case of a shapefile this is in actual fact a misnomer because a shapefile consists of a collection of files. Without going into detail: each of these files does something slightly different and the the software we will be using requires needs all of them in order to understand the data. 1.3 Adding data Now we have downloaded and organised our data, we can open QGIS. QGIS is a free and open-source cross-platform desktop geographic information system application that supports viewing, editing, and analysis of geospatial data. Start QGIS. It may take a little while before QGIS has started, so be patient. Once opened, you will see the QGIS interface which will look something like this: Figure 1.4: The QGIS interface on Windows. [Enlarge image] On the left hand sizes you see two panels: Layers and Browser. We do not really need the second one, so you can close it by clicking on the x if you like. We can now start by adding our data. We will start by adding our gb_outline. Click on Layer &gt; Add Layer &gt; Add Vector Layer …. Figure 1.5: Adding vector data. [Enlarge image] Click on the three dots (…) next to the Vector Dataset(s) box and navigate to your working directory. Then go into your gb_outline folder and click on the gb_outline file with the SHP File type. Figure 1.6: Loading the gb_outline shapefile. [Enlarge image] Click Open. Then click Add. If you get a message popping up saying something about “Select Transformations for gb_outline” just click on OK. Now Close the dialog box. You should now see the outline of Great Britain loaded: Figure 1.7: Outline of Great Britain loaded. [Enlarge image] Now repeat these steps for our gb_cities file, making sure again that inside your gb_cities folder you select the file with the SHP File type. You now will have both data loaded. One thing to note is that the colours of your gb_outline and gb_cities files may be different than the ones in the image - QGIS randomly picks a colour when a map layer is first loaded. Before doing anything else, now would be a good time to save our QGIS project. Go to Project &gt; Save as and save your project in your working directory as kde_map. Figure 1.8: Saving your QGIS project. [Enlarge image] 1.4 Organising our layers Now we have our first set of data loaded, we can reorganise them a little. In the Layers panel, we can drag the gb_outline layer on top of the gb_cities layer to change their order. We can also change a layer’s colour (right click on gb_outline or gb_cities &gt; Properties … &gt; change the colour under the Symbology tab), and zoom in and out of the map by scrolling: Figure 1.9: Organising the order of our data and changing symbology. [Enlarge image] 1.5 Inspecting data in Excel The next thing we want to do is have a closer look at the surname data before loading them too in QGIS. It is good practice to see how your data looks like before you take any further steps. Note The surname files that we downloaded are in a so-called csv format. csv stands for comma (or character) separated values. A csv file can be thought of as stripped down Excel spreadsheets in which every column of data is separated by a comma. If you open a csv file within Excel, however, it will look “normal”. Navigate to your working directory and go to surname_date. Now open the bearers_of_vandijk file using Excel. Figure 1.10: Inspecting our crime data csv. [Enlarge image] Our dataset only contains three columns with data: name, x, and y. The x and y columns contain the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the recorded location of the individual bearer of the surname, respectively. For the connoisseurs: these coordinates are already projected in EPSG 27700 (British National Grid). After inspecting the data, you can close Excel again. Make sure that you do not save the file. 1.6 Loading point data into QGIS Now we know what we are dealing with, we can load our surname data into QGIS. To do so, there are several steps we need to take: Go to Layer &gt; Add Layer &gt; Add Delimited Text Layer …. Because our data is a csv file we need to load it as a file in which columns are delimited by a certain character; a comma in our case. Click on the three dots (…) next to the File name box and navigate to your working directory. Then go into your surname_data folder and Open the bearers_of_vandijk file. Under Geometry Definitions make sure that X field is set to x and Y field is set to y. Here we inform QGIS that we are dealing with locations. Without going into further details, we need to tell QGIS in which projection our crime locations are recorded. With a projection QGIS will know how to plot the crime locations on their correct positions. To do so, still under Geometry Definitions tab, click on the Select CRS button. You will find this is directly next to the invalid projection message. In the Filter box type: EPSG 27700. Only one option should show up: OSGB 1936 / British National Grid. Select this option and click OK. Now click Add. For large datasets this may take a little bit of time! Click Close to exit the dialog box. The GIF below summarises these steps: Figure 1.11: Loading our surname data into QGIS. [Enlarge image] Here we now have the location of the bearer of every surname Van Dijk recorded in 2016 across Great Britain. We can zoom to the extent of the surname layer by right clicking on the bearers_of_vandijk layer and opting for Zoom to Layer: Figure 1.12: Recorded location of every Van Dijk in 2016 in Great Britain. [Enlarge image] We now have all data we need to visualise our first surname dataset, and with this we have reached the end of Section 1. Note Do not forget to save your progress once a while! 1.7 Tasks Now you know the basics of loading data into QGIS, you can go ahead and try: Load one of the other surname datasets in the same fashion as we did with the bearers_of_vandijk dataset. Visually compare the distributions of the different surname datasets by toggling the different surname layers on and off. "],["basic-visualisation.html", "2 Basic visualisation 2.1 Changing symbologoy 2.2 Creating a heatmap 2.3 Adding a basemap 2.4 Tasks", " 2 Basic visualisation 2.1 Changing symbologoy Now we have loaded our first surname dataset, the next thing we want to do is get some more insight into our surname data. Let’s start by changing the symbology of our gb_cities layer by adding in place names for some context. We will also change the symbology of our gb_outline background layer and the general appearance of our surname layer. Updating the symbology of the gb_outline layer: Right click on the gb_outline layer in the Layers panel and click on Properties …. Here we can change the symbology of the layer. Under the Symbology tab make sure that the selection is set to Single Symbol (the default) and click on Simple Fill. Click on the dropdown menu button next to Fill color and select Choose Color …. In the HTML notation box type: #bfbebe and click OK. Now click on the dropdown menu button next to Stroke style and select No Pen. Click Apply and click OK. Updating the symbology of the gb_cities layer: Right click on the gb_cities layer in the Layers panel and click on Properties …. Under the Symbology tab make sure that the selection is set to Single Symbol (the default) and click on Simple Marker. Change the the size of the marker to to 2.4 and, using the dropdown menu button next to Stroke style, set the Stroke style to No Pen. Click Apply. Now click on the Labels tab and change the No Labels setting to Single Labels. Click on the Value dropdown menu button and make sure that Value is set to city. This is the variable containing the names of our cities. Click Apply and click OK. Updating the symbology of the bearers_of_vandijk layer: Right click on the bearers_of_vandijk layer in the Layers panel and click on Properties …. Under the Symbology tab make sure that the selection is set to Single Symbol (the default), click on dot blue and click on Simple Marker. Change the the size of the marker to to 2 and, using the dropdown menu button next to Stroke style, set the Stroke style to No Pen. Click Apply and click OK. Once you have updated the symbology of your three layers, you can reorganise the order of your layers to make sure tha the gb_cities layers is drawn on top. The QGIS screen now shows a map with an updated symbology, including our several large cities. The GIF below summarises these steps: Figure 2.1: Adding labels to our gb_cities layer and changing the symbology of our other layers. [Enlarge image] 2.2 Creating a heatmap Rather than simply changing the symbology of the point layers, we can also create a quick hotspot or heatmap. QGIS can do this automatically by mapping the density of the points: Right click on the bearers_of_vandijk layer in the Layers panel and click on Properties …. Here we can change the symbology of the layer. At the top of the menu change Single Symbol to Heatmap. Using the drop down menu, change the Color ramp to Magma for a little more exciting map. Under Layer Rendering set the Opacity to 60%, so to blend the heatmap with the background. Click Apply. This may take a few seconds. Then click OK. We now have created a rather nice visualisation of all bearers of Van Dijk in Great Britain - The GIF below summarises these steps: Figure 2.2: Creating a basic heatmap of our Van Dijk surname layer. [Enlarge image] 2.3 Adding a basemap Based on the gb_outline and gb_cities layers, we are able to contextualise our heatmap. However, we can also add something called a base map layer. A base map is a layer with geographic information that serves as a background and is incredibly useful when you want to add some additional context to your map. We do need a little plugin to add this base map. We can do that as follows: Go to Plugins &gt; Manage and Install Plugins …. Search for QuickMapServices and click on Install plugin. Once the plugin is installed you can go to Web &gt; QuickMapServices &gt; OSM &gt; OSM Standard. OSM stands for OpenStreetMap. OpenStreetMap is a collaborative project to create a free editable geographic database of the world. It may take a few seconds to load the base map. Now reorganise the layers The GIF below summarises these steps: Figure 2.3: Adding a basemap layer. [Enlarge image] 2.4 Tasks That was not too difficult. Feel free to play around with different colours, settings and visualisation options. In addition: Create a heatmap layer for: Novak, Longley. Visually compare the distributions of the Novak, Longley and Van Dijk surname heatmaps by toggling the different surname layers on and off. Any similarities? Which background layer do you find easier for these comparisions: the OSM basemap or the combination of the gb_outline and gb_cities layers? "],["kde-parametrisation.html", "3 KDE parametrisation 3.1 Kernel Density Estimation 3.2 QGIS processing toolbox 3.3 Displaying KDE values 3.4 Extracting KDE values 3.5 Tasks", " 3 KDE parametrisation 3.1 Kernel Density Estimation Where the heatmap symbology is a nice way to quickly visualise a set of point data, there is only few options to change the result. A more advanced way to analyse the density of a point process, is through something called Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). KDE is a statistical technique to generate a smooth continuous distribution between data points that represent the density of the underlying pattern. Note The heatmap that we created through the Symbology tab is in actual fact created by an on the fly KDE calculation with a set of default parameters. When executing a KDE, a surface is produced (for the connoisseurs: a raster dataset) that details the estimated distribution of our event point data over space. Each cell within the raster contains a value that is this estimated density at that location; when visualised in its entirety as the whole raster, we can quickly identify areas of high and low density, i.e. where are clusters are located in our data set. To create this surface, a KDE computes a localised density for small subsets of our study area using overlapping windows, called a kernel. A kernel defines the shape and size of the window and can also weight the points, using a defined kernel function. The simplest kernel function is a basic kernel where each point in the kernel window is assigned equal weight. When we use a different kernel type, we are looking to weight the points within our kernel differently: Figure 3.1: Kernel types and their distributions. Each function will result in a slightly different estimation. Levine (2013) summarises the differences between the kernels as follows: The normal distribution weighs all points in the study area, though near points are weighted more highly than distant points. The other four techniques use a circumscribed circle around the grid cell. The uniform distribution weighs all points within the circle equally. The quartic function weighs near points more than far points, but the fall off is gradual. The triangular function weighs near points more than far points within the circle, but the fall off is more rapid. Finally, the negative exponential weighs near points much more highly than far points within the circle and the decay is very rapid. The kernel density approach generates a grid of density values whose cell size is smaller than that of the kernel window. Each cell is assigned the density value computed for the kernel window centered on that cell. The size of this window is called the bandwidth. The resulting surface is created from these individually, locally calculated density values. Another way to think about it is as a smoothed histogram, but now created in two-dimensional space. The explanation by Jake VanderPlas in his Python Data Science Handbook explains this idea in much more detail and very clearly. TL;DR A Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is the method that underlies the idea of a heatmap: creating a smoothed surface of a set of discrete locations. 3.2 QGIS processing toolbox Where we can use the heatmap symbology to create a quick-and-dirty KDE surface to visualise a set of points, QGIS also comes with a set of geospatial processing tools that can be used to execute a variety of spatial analyses. One of these processing tools is called Kernel Density Estimation. The difference between the heatmap and the geospatial processing tool is that the latter gives the option to finetune the parameters of the KDE as well as that it allows you to save the output as a separate data file. Let’s run a KDE on your bearers_of_vandijk layer, but this time using the Processing Toolbox: In the main menubar, click on the Toolbox button to open the Processing Toolbox: In the search bar type: Kernel Density Estimation. Double click on: Heatmap (Kernel Density Estimation). Note If the Toolbox button is not visible it is likely that the Processing plugin is not properly activated. You can activate this as follows: Go to Plugins &gt; Manage and Install Plugins …. Go to the Installed tab and type processing in the search box. Then tick the box in front of Processing off and on again to force reload the Toolbox. Click Close. [See screenshot] In the Heatmap (Kernel Density Estimation) dialogue box, select bearers_of_vandijk as your Point Layer. Change the Radius to 10. Click on the unit dropdown menu button and make sure that it is set to kilometers. In the Output raster size section, change the Rows to 500, the value for Columns should update automatically to 310. Click on the three dots (…) next to the [Save to temporary file] box and click on Save to File … and navigate to your working directory. Create a new folder named surname_kde and save the output of this geoprocessing tool as kde_vandijk_10km. Click Save and click Run to calculate the KDE. Click Close. The GIF below summarises these steps: Figure 3.2: Calculating a KDE with a bandwidth of 10km for the bearers of Van Dijk. [Enlarge image] The result is a smoothed version of the spatial point locations that represent all bearers of the surname Van Dijk. To be fair: it does look a little bit as if we only changed the symbology. Let’s calculate another KDE, but this time we will use a larger bandwidth of 30 kilometres instead of the 10 kilometres we have used previously. The GIF below summarises these steps: Figure 3.3: Calculating a KDE with a bandwidth of 30km for the bearers of Van Dijk. [Enlarge image] Although not exactly pretty, the KDE layers show an estimate of “how many bearers” of Van Dijk are expected in each of the individual grid cells of our layer. Currently, as can be seen in the Layers panel, for the kde_vandijk_30km the highest density is 28.2531. This highest density seems to be concentrated in London - you can toggle the gb_cities layer to confirm. 3.3 Displaying KDE values We now have calculated two KDEs, however, the quick heatmap we created earlier by changing the symbology of our point layer looked much better. Let’s do something about this by changing the symbology of our kde_vandijk_30km layer. We will also adjust the minimum visible density to only show the areas in which the bearers of Van Dijk are mostly concentrated. Switch off the visibility of the kde_vandijk_10km layer in the Layers panel by unticking the checkbox in front of the layer. Right click on the kde_vandijk_30km layer in the Layers panel and click on Properties …. Here we can change the symbology of the layer. Change the Color gradient to White to black. Change the minimum and maximum value of this Color gradient to 5 and 28.2531, respectively. Use the Contrast enhancement dropdown menu to select the Stretch and Clip to MinMax option. Click Apply. Click OK. We now have a much better visualisation with darker areas indicating higher densities of the bearers of Van Dijk. The GIF below summarises these steps: Figure 3.4: Changing the KDE visualisation parameters. [Enlarge image] 3.4 Extracting KDE values Instead of simply updating the KDE values that we are displaying, we can also extract the values of the KDE layer and save these as a separate layer. We can do this with something called the Raster calculator. This little tool allows us to only keep the values above a certain threshold. Let’s extract all raster cells where there is at least 5 bearers of Van Dijk expected; similar as to what we just did with your visualisation. In the Processing Toolbox search bar type: Raster calculator. Double click on: Raster calculator. In the Expression toolbox type: \"kde_vandijk_30km@1 / (kde_vandijk_30km@1 &gt; 5)\". This is to ensure that the calculation will only return values of 5 and above. Click on the three dots (…) next to the referecne layer(s) (used for automated extend, cellsize and CRS) [optional] box and tick the box in front of kde_vandijk_30km [EPSG:277000]. Click OK. In the Output CRS [optional] dropdown menu, select Project CRS: EPSG:27700 - OSGB 1936 / British National Grid. Click on the three dots (…) next to the [Save to temporary file] box and click on Save to File … and navigate to your working directory. Save the output in yoursurname_kde folder as kde_vandijk_10km_5min. Click Run. Click Close. We have now created a full, separate, new layer, only containing the raster cells where there is at least 5 bearers of Van Dijk expected. The GIF below summarises these steps: Figure 3.5: Extracting KDE values from our raster layer.

The final step is to finalise the styling and get the map out of QGIS. This is done through the QGIS Print Layout: Go to Project &gt; New Print Layout …. Give it a name, e.g. kde_map. A new window opens up. In the toolbar on the left hand side, click on the Add map button: Draw a box on the canvas. The KDE surname map should now appear. Using the toolbar on the left hand side, there is several other options such as Add scale bar, Add North Arrow, and Add Legend. There are lots of options to play around with! Once you are happy with your map, you can save your map by going to Layout &gt; Export as Image …. If you get a message popping up saying something about “Project Contains WMS Layers” just click on Close. Navigate to your working directory, give your map a name and click Save. Also click Save on the next window that pops up. These steps should create an image which you should be able to find in your working directory. The GIF below summarises these steps: This image is now ready to be used outside QGIS! Note There are many more options on how to style the maps, so do play around with colours and settings when making your maps. 4.3 Tasks make maps, include title, north arrow, use different projects for different surname data, combine (vector based) representations into one map to make comparisons easier. rather than using absolute values you can also scale the values; which may allow for a fairer comparisions when it comes to distrubtions – try it out.
